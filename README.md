# Forecasting Techniques Spreadsheet

## As an assignment for IE 500: Supply Chain Engineering course, I worked on this assignment that included forecasting demand based on given historical data
### Kindly review the attached spreadsheet
### Forecasting methods used: 
1. Last Value Method 
2. Moving average method
3. Exponential Smoothing
4. AR, ARMA, ARIMA models

I also evaluated the accuracy for these models based on the MAD, MSE, STD, MAPE metrics

Apart from these methods, as part of the course, I studied Time Series forecasting and weighted moving average method,
